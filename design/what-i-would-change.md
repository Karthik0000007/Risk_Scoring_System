# What I Would Change With More Time or Team Support

## Decision
Certain limitations are intentionally accepted to prioritize clarity and safety.

## Changes With More Time
- Add canary deployments for model rollout
- Introduce horizontal pod autoscaling
- Add alerting rules for latency and error rates

## Changes With Larger Team
- Separate training and inference services
- Add human-in-the-loop moderation workflow
- Multi-region deployment for availability

## Why These Were Deferred
- Increase operational complexity
- Require stronger monitoring maturity
- Not aligned with a 14-day solo project scope
